    1 Corinthians 6:20 NASB1995

    For you have been bought with a price: 
    therefore glorify God in your body.


Paraphrase:

    Alam mo bang binili tayo ng Diyos
  sa napakamahal na presyo para tayo ay
  mapasakanya upang papurihan siya.



Journal:

    The topic title of this verse is "The Body Is the Lordâ€™s"
 which means our body is God's gift. It is owned by Him.
 so we must not say that my body is my life. Because we do not
 own anything we start as nothing but God give us everything 
 we have right now.


Application:

    - Appricate our body because it is God's given gift to us.
    - Learn to Appricate also the other people body even it 
        we see something that is not complete.
    

Prayer Concerns:

    - Pray for strength to overcome all our worldy body desire.
        to overcome all.
    - Pray for the children of God who are experiencing this 
     mindset that this is my body all they want it they can.
    - Pray for all christians that we must Appricate each
     one of us and remember that all of this is a gift a 
     a rent from God.
