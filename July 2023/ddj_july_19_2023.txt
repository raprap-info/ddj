    Isaiah 46:9-10 NASB1995

    Remember the former things long past, For I am God, 
    and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me,
    Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times 
    things which have not been done, Saying, ‘My purpose will be 
    established, And I will accomplish all My good pleasure’


Paraphrase:

    Alalahannin natin na noon pa ay ipinakita na ng Diyos
kung sino siya at walang sinong diyos diyosan ang makakapantay sa
kanya at ito ay para maestablished ang kanyang purpose.

Journal:

    The topic title of this verse is "Babylon’s Idols and the True God",
which refers to Babylon’s Idols. God do not want other gods than Him.
we know that God is a jealous God. He wanted only Him because in the 
first place He is who gave us life and what we had right now.


    This verse also a reminder for us that do not create our own gods.
which means only the true God we need to worship.



Prayer Concerns:

- Pray for the courage to flee from other gods that christians right now 
 that are slowly worshipping.

- Pray for the heart that the Lord gave us to have a joyful and cheerful
 heart and mind to worship Him everyday.
