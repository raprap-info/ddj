Journal:

    The topic title of this verse is "Serve God Willingly"
we know that being a christian is not a one time win like winning 
in a lottery or some prizes but being a christian is a journey that 
we need to endure and be sure of our descision we made before
accepting our Lord Jesus as Lord and saviour of our lives.

    So, now as we live and know the truth about living a life obeying
or aligning to the will of God we experience so diffuclties and 
challenges that sometimes it gives as anxiety. But on this verse 
what peter is telling the churches the christian that if we are 
facing some trials or challenges in life we should cast it all to
God.

Application:

- We have diffuclties in life that sometimes it gives anxiety we need 
    to trust the Lord for His answer and help throughout our journey.

Prayer Concerns:

- Pray for the differentt trials and challenges that we face to overcome it all
    by the help of our God.
- Pray to learn more to trust God other that anything else.
- Pray for our leaders who are doing there best to teach us 
    about God.
