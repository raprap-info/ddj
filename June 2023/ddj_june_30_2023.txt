John 1:13 - New Living Translation

They are rebornâ€”not with a physical birth 
resulting from human passion or plan, but a 
birth that comes from God.


Journal
 
    This verse is one of the important key about christian 
  journey we can see on this verse that birth that comes from
  God is not the same as physical birth because physical birth
  is bonded with the inherit sins from our ancestors adam and eve.
  But the beauty and i think all christian will be reminded about 
  this verse that when a person received Christ as Lord and 
  Saviour of his/her life will get this assurances that he/she is
  a new person now.

    sins that our past life without Christ in our lives will prevail
    but continue to ask God's help to overcome this struggles in our lives.

Prayer Concerns

   their habbitual sins and may they overcome and be a winner and
   may Lord by the helped of the Holy Spirit they will finish their
   own journey in life.
