Isaiah 44:24 NLT

This is what the LORD says— your Redeemer and Creator: 
“I am the LORD, who made all things. I alone stretched out the heavens.
Who was with me when I made the earth?


Journal

    This verse reminds me of who God is before the creation of the world and also this reminds me of 
  a person who are trying to apply for a job that he or she was presenting his or her resume or 
  curiculum vitae to the company that he or she wants to apply and on that document it states his or
  her background that where he / she working before and what are his / her expertise. But here in the 
  verse The Lord states who He is before creation of the World and by that He is clearly showing how 
  all powerful and crediable to trust Him. In this verse I saw that the Lord acknowledges the presence 
  of Trinity which is the Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit.

Application
    
        Trust the Lord whatever , wherever or whenever circumstances that we may experience.
        Remember The Lord is not just watching over us. But also He cares for us.
