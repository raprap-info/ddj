Journal


    The context group of this verse is about the "Jeremiah Call 
and First Visions" when i ready this verse and medidate I saw a
repeatition of preposition word which is the word "Before" 

Preposition means a word governing, and usually preceding,
a noun or pronoun and expressing a relation to another word 
or element in the clause,


 In this verse it shows how powerful God is because no one
 can comprehend God's visions and no one can do like Him that sees
 the past and the future even in the movie X Men professor x can only 
 read mind of the person one by one. But God can do it stimutaneously 
 to all people in the world amazing that's how Great our God is.



Application

 - Do not rely on our own wisdom and strength because we are limited.
 - Ask the Lord about your future and also share your 
    goals and plans to Him. 
 - Ask the Lord for our forgiveness of our sins because we cannot
    hide anything to Him. Because He knows everything from us.
