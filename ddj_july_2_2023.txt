Isaiah 43:7 - New Living Translation

        Bring all who claim me as their God,
        for I have made them for my glory.
        It was I who created them.’”


Journal

    The title of this first part of the chaper is
about The Savior of Israel one of the key note that 
struck me is about God is the one who make a way to
us human will get a realizations about Him. And by
that our eyes and hearts are open to learn more and
seek more about our God and the journey of being 
a christian is now begin. 

    When the person realize who he/she was before and 
who is God he/she will bring back all the glory that 
our God's deserves.




Application

- Be patience when it comes to sharing the Gospel to
    others sometimes we experience rejections and 
    even bully always remember maybe their hearts is 
    not yet open to hear the Gospel. But do not lose 
    hope remeber them in your prayer.


Prayer Concerns

- Pray for the loss souls that are rejecting 
  the Gospel about Jesus that may the help of the 
  Holy Spirit someday their hearts and eyes will be
  open.

- Pray for the our love onces who are not yet know 
  about the salvation the our Saviour Jesus Christ
  did on the cross. Remember them always in your 
  prayer and may the Lord make a way that someday
  they will know who God is and received the 
  Gospel with open hearts.

- Pray for all the missionaries who dedicate their lives 
  to share the word of God even to the places that very 
  restricted, pray for the strength and wisdom and also
  pray for the supports that may continue.
